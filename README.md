Webpage generation and deployment on esp-32 micro-controllers. This is a testing project to automatically minify and wrap html pages into a C++ header file. This file includes 1 setup script to initialize all webpages from strings into the server memory. The header file also defines any global scope variables used in transmitting data via the webpage.

The webpage compiler/minify-er is capable of handling full html and css, transmitting data to the micro-controller via post response forms, and updating the webpage with real-time data from ajax requests. All of these features are handled by the compiler and do not require any additional setup, just proper implementation (see Ajax Response project). These features may be reused on multiple pages and multiple times within each page.
